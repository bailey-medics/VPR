# Documentation update

Can you go through all of the documentation in `/docs/src/` and the code itself. Match the code and its associated documentation. Update the documentation to match the workings/ideology from code. Take Code to be canonical. It the documentation mentions something that the code does not currently implement, do not worry about this and leave be. It there is mention of something in the code that needs a new documentation file, then please add.

Make sure to update `/docs/src/SUMMARY.md` at the end.
