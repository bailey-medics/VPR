# Versioned Patient Repository (VPR)

Welcome to the Versioned Patient Repository (VPR) documentation!

The VPR uses files rather than traditional databases to store patient data. On top of this, version control via Git is used to track changes to patient records over time, providing a robust and auditable history of all modifications.

Please view the [VPR overview](./vpr-overview.md) if you would like to read a detailed overview of the reasoning behind the design and build of the VPR.
