# Thanks to

The work that I have done with VPR is in many ways due to the time and effort that Dr Marcus Baw has put into his own version of a git file based patient record system call [gitEHR](https://github.com/gitehr/gitehr). I openly admit to copying his ideas and implementations in my own approach to building VPR.
